# Testing

[Back to README](README.md)

This is incomplete, I ran out of time... Student Care have suggested to me to submit anyway so as to not incur the wrath of submitting a late project & so I can receive feedback and what I have achieved thus far. Thanks for taking the time to view my project, and hopefully my README will be actually complete next time around.

### Validation

#### HTML
The HTML validation was completed with the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). This was done by copying the address of each project page and passing it to the validator. This was necessary to test the code in its final state after being rendered in the Django templates. The HTML code contains no issues.

#### CSS and Javascript
The CSS validation was completed with the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Any issues highlighted by the validators were fixed. The code now contains no validity issues.

#### Javascript
The JavaScript validation was completed with the [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) code analysis tool. Any issues highlighted by the validators were fixed. The code now contains no validity issues.

### Python
All Python code was written to be PEP 8 compliant with the final code being tested with the command ```python3 -m flake8```.

#### Formatters


### Testing User Journey


### Testing User Stories

    - This is true with some smaller monitors.
    - Although, the sticky header and fixed footer encourage scrolling.
1. Functionality.
    - All CRUD functionality is available.
    - Dynamic form is indeed dynamic and input field can be added or taken away.

### iPad/iPad Pro

1. The UI is clear and concise.
    - I believe the UI is best on this screen size.
1. Functionality.
    - All CRUD functionality is available.
    - Dynamic form is indeed dynamic and input field can be added or taken away.
1. Contrasting with the desktop view:

### Mobile 

1. Problems.
    - Much like Showcase Cinema's Website the seat chart does not translate well onto mobile.
1. Functionality.
1. Contrasting with the desktop view:
