Code Institute Project 4

It uses a relational database, Stripe payment and is designed to be responsive across multiple devices. amphii allows users to purchase and view tickets for shows.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we are making a copy of the original repository on a GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository. This is done with the following steps:

- Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
- Click the button and now you should have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

- Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository.
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location that you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
